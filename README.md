# Stock-Prediction
ðŸš€ Exciting Project Alert! ðŸš€



I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a Stock Prediction App built with Streamlit! ðŸ“ˆâœ¨



This app leverages historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and uses Facebook's Prophet model to forecast future stock prices. Here's a quick overview of what it does:

1) Historical Data Visualization: Choose from a selection of popular stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, GME) and visualize their historical performance.

Interactive Forecasting: Select the number of years for your prediction, and the app generates a forecast for up to 8 years.

2) Prophet Model: The app employs the powerful Prophet model to create accurate and interactive predictions.

3) Streamlit for UI: The entire user interface is built using Streamlit, making it intuitive and easy to use.



Check out some of the features:

* Raw data visualization with interactive time series plots.

* Future stock price predictions with detailed forecast components.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in collaborating or if you have any questions about the project!
